# DoubleCaptcha (OSSN Component)
It may be overkill to have 2 Captchas but safety is the best priority. This is the original OSSN Captcha designed to be used side by side using the newer ReCaptcha v2 and v3 components. This is done since there are ReCaptcha solvers are available and you may wanna use this as a backup Captcha

## Why? ReCaptcha exists and why do you created this useless thing?
"Buster is a browser extension which helps you to solve difficult captchas by completing reCAPTCHA audio challenges using speech recognition. Challenges are solved by clicking on the extension button at the bottom of the reCAPTCHA widget."

Read that thing above, it says that it can bypass ReCaptcha. But not the original OSSN Captcha. The original OSSN Captcha is using the older non picture method.

Atleast, you have a backup Captcha but still this is not a gurantee that a computer program will not be able to bypass this backup Captcha.
